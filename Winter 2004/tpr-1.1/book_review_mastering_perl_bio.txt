"Mastering Perl for Bioinformatics" is written well, but
beware, it might not be what you are looking for. It is not
a book for the general Perl folk eager to learn
bioinformatics.  It is a book about Perl, with some detours
into other topics of computer science.  A book "for
programmers who want to learn more about bioinformatics" (as
the back cover says) should include theoretical backgroud,
descriptions of the problems bioinformaticians are trying to
solve, etc. None of this is present.

The treatment of Perl object-oriented programming is clear
and detailed, and dives into the  advanced topics like
attribute lists, inheritance, and AUTOLOAD. The discussion
of relational databases in the 6th chapter is also very nice
and gives a good start for Perl programmers  who want to use
of the DBI modules. I utterly enjoyed the explanation of the
Edit Distance algorithm with a reference to Dynamic
Programming in the 2nd chapter.

If you're a beginning Perl bioinformatics programmer,
interested in OOP, databases, web, graphics and the Bioperl
library, you may find this book useful.  If you want to
learn bioinformatics, you'll have to find something else.
