Perl Mongers News
by Dave Adler

To start things off, we have two brand new groups of Mongers: Aarau.pm
in Switzerland and Cascais.pm in Portugal. Also, ThousandOaks.pm is
resuming regular monthly meetings as of December and Jacksonville.pm has
requested that I tell you that they're still there.

A number of Perl Monger groups are getting Perl workshops up and running
in their area. London and Melbourne are having theirs in December while
Israel, Holland and Germany each have one scheduled for February. Thomas
Klausner is keeping up with these - or at least trying to, as more keep
popping up all the time - at http://www.yapceurope.org/workshops.html

Perl Seminar New York (aka perlsemny) will work on testing
Text::Template, joining Chicago.pm, SouthFlorida.pm and London.pm in
working on the Phalanx testing project. Details on the Phalanx Kwiki at
http://phalanx.kwiki.org/

On the international relations front, Paris.pm seems to be having a
large number of foreign vistiors, SaoPaulo.pm is entertaining a member
of Rio.pm for the bulk of November and NY.pm may be getting a brief
visit from London.

Finally, Mark Jason Dominus' long-awaited book is almost in physical
form, and Philadelphia.pm is going to be helping him put together a book
signing. No details yet, but when they arrive, phl.pm will surely
announce them.

Happy Mongering.
