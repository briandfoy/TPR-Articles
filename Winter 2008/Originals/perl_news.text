	•	ActiveState tells me that the new PPM servers are now available. This is the new hotness that Jan Dubois talked about at the beginning of the year. You need the PPM 4 client, which is already in the 5.10 distros and the 5.8 distros since build 818. 
The new repos have many more modules. These numbers are straight from ActiveState today: 
Platform Vers | Old Repo | New Repo (CPANfly)
