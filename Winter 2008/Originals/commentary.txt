<pstyle:Feature Lead>Why isn<0x2019>t the Perl community <0x201C>corporate-enterprise<0x201D> enough? I don<0x2019>t have all of the answers, but I know some of the problems we have to solve.
<pstyle:Feature Para>Nothing could make me more happy than the subject of the next YAPC::Europe, <0x201C>Corporate Perl<0x201D>, and my expectation level is high. What will the Perl gurus and my peers come up with? People get surprised when I talk about <0x201C>Corporate-Enterprise Perl<0x201D> some even tell me it can<0x2019>t be more <0x2019>corporate-enterprise<0x2019> than it is right now, validating their point by telling me companies are making lots of money because of Perl. I have no doubt that all the duct taping we are doing is generating money but what makes, or could make Perl worthy of the <0x201C>corporate<0x201D> adjective?
<pstyle:Feature Para>We certainly feel comfortable in the world of Agile development methods, SOA, virtual machines, web services, and enterprise integration. I guess that this is due to the fact that we are flexible and curious. Wild and daring would be another way to put it.
<pstyle:Feature Para>But I believe we are making the biggest possible mistake. Pride is our sin. We <CharStyle:pod-I>know<CharStyle:> we are corporate-enterprise worthy, We <CharStyle:pod-I>know<CharStyle:> that companies that do not embrace our enthusiasm and ways are not worth working for. Our pride is well deserved and it certainly is the most important factor in our success so far, if not the only one, in the duct-tape world where credit is given only when things break. Still, I believe we<0x2019>re making a mistake. We should be judged by the industry not doing the opposite. To be judge we need to be visible and I<0x2019>d certainly like the The Perl Foundation to very seriously start doing something about that.
<pstyle:Feature Para>Becoming more corporation-enterprise worthy is going to be a balancing act. The Perl community has a soul and we must keep it while working with the soulless software industry. Or maybe we shouldn<0x2019>t, and accept we just want to be programming pariahs that get things done. In any case, the current limbo must stop.
<pstyle:Feature Para>Since we all more or less know why we are good at what we are doing and why Perl is the best fitted tool to use, I<0x2019>m not going to list the positive sides of Perl as a development environment (yes, environment) but I<0x2019>ll try to list some of the things that have been hinderances so far.
<pstyle:Feature Sub Section>Scribblers
<pstyle:Feature Para>Perl being used as a scribbling tool and for those who use it in that way. Frankly, I intensely dislike them. Not because they are new to the trade or Perl but because they do nothing to get better. Worse than that, the more they learn about Perl the worse code they produce. Out of a hundred Perl beginners, most remain beginners because they are happy with what they have. Perl duct taped their problem, on to the next problem!
<pstyle:Feature Sub Section>CPAN
<pstyle:Feature Para>CPAN is one of Perl<0x2019>s killer features, but it<0x2019>s not perfect either. It<0x2019>s success is due in part to its low barrier to entry, but that also brings other problems: varying code quality of modules, difficulty finding what I need among many alternatives, and many modules with bad documentation or poor version management. Mitigating these problems should be a top priority.
<pstyle:Feature Sub Section>Handling the industry
<pstyle:Feature Para>No single point of entry for companies to find the needed information to run a modern development environment with Perl. There<0x2019>s a lot to use but it<0x2019>s all bits and pieces. We simply don<0x2019>t care. I, as a developer, like the freedom it give but I wonder if it<0x2019>s a viable strategy for companies.
<pstyle:Feature Sub Section>Tools
<pstyle:Feature Para>I like the debugger that comes with Perl, but it<0x2019>s as usable as a 1950 telephone switch. The state of the standard Perl tools and integration of those tools is not very good. New projects  want to solve the problem so there is hope but those projects should be helped too.
<pstyle:Feature Para>Your opinion matters! I<0x2019>m one in a million, hmm, I would like in how many I am in but that information is not available either, and I<0x2019>d like to see better  integration into existing applications (this is what made python popular), serious work to integrate eclipse (this is what makes things look serious to companies), serious work with google, Microsoft, IBM and other companies that have the means of putting Perl in the industrial tracks. Work with academia so they produce something better than lobotomized developers that will use Perl to scribble something fast and dirty to save their skin and burn mine in the long run.
<pstyle:Feature Para>What corporations expect of Perl is of primordial interest and will shape the future of Perl as much as our own expectations. The next YAPC::Europe is indeed going to be interesting and I hope that its subject will spark an interest in the other YAPC<0x2019>s too.
