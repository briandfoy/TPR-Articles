The name \I{peephole optimizer} comes from
the image of sliding a small window 
over the target code attempting to 
replace patterns of instructions 
by better ones. If we have a look at the code 
generated in the previous phase for the input
\verb|a = 5-b*2|
we see that produces:
\begin{verbatim}
$N1 = b * 2
$N2 = 5 - $N1
a = $N2
\end{verbatim}
PIR allows memory instructions involving 
three arguments like \verb|a = b + c|.
This fact and the observation that \verb|$N2| 
is used only once 
lead us to conclude that 
the former translation can be changed to:
\begin{verbatim}
$N1 = b * 2
a = 5 - $N1
\end{verbatim}
Perl regular expressions constitute a formidable
tool to implement \I{peephole optimization}. The
regexp below finds patterns 
\begin{verbatim}
$N# = something
IDENT = $N#
\end{verbatim}
and substitutes them by \verb|IDENT = something|:
\begin{verbatim}
sub peephole_optimization {
  $_[0] =~ 
   s{(\$N\d+)\s*=\s*(.*\n)\s*
     ([a-zA-Z_]\w*)\s*=\s*\1}
    {$3 = $2}gx;
}
\end{verbatim}
