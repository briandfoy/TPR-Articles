Almost any reader of this Journal knows what {\it Parsing} is about.
One of the strengths of Perl is its excellence for text analysis. 
Additionally to its embedded regular expression capacities, modules 
like \code{Parse::RecDescent} \cite{conwayrd} and 
\code{Parse::Yapp} \cite{desarmenien} make easier the task of text 
understanding and text transformation.
This is in clear contrast with the absence of Perl 5 
generic tools\footnote{There are however very good specific ones,
for example, for \code{XML} and \code{HTML} support and 
symbolic mathematics
% \cite{muller}
}
giving support for the subsequent stages
of text processing.
The exception being the module \code{Language::AttributeGrammar}
\cite{luke}. Parrot does well in this 
chapter, having the Parrot Grammar Engine (PGE) \cite{michaud}
and the Tree Grammar Engine (TGE)
\cite{randaltge}.

\code{Parse::Eyapp} (Extended yapp) is a collection of modules
that extends Francois Desarmenien \code{Parse::Yapp} \code{1.05}:
Any \code{yapp} program runs without changes with \code{eyapp}.
Additionally \code{Parse::Eyapp} provides new 
functionalities like named attributes,
EBNF-like expressions, modifiable default actions,
abstract syntax tree building and translation schemes. 
It also provides a language for tree transformations.
This article introduces the basics of 
translator construction with \code{Parse::Eyapp} through an
example that compiles infix expressions into Parrot 
Intermediate Representation (PIR)\cite{randal04}.
The input to the program will be a (semicolon separated)
list of infix expressions, like:

\begin{verbatim}
1  b = 5;
2  a = b+2;
3  a = 2*(a+b)*(2-4/2); # is zero
4  print a;
5  d = (a = a+1)*4-b;
6  c = a*b+d;
7  print c;
8  print d
\end{verbatim}

and the output is an equivalent
PIR: 
\begin{verbatim}
 1  .sub 'main' :main
 2     .local num a, b, c, d
 3     b = 5
 4     a = b + 2
 5     a = 0 # expression at line 3 
 6     print "a = "     # above was
 7     print a    # reduced to zero
 8     print "\n" # at compile time
 9     a = a + 1
10     $N5 = a * 4
11     d = $N5 - b
12     $N7 = a * b
13     c = $N7 + d
14     print "c = "
15     print c
16     print "\n"
17     print "d = "
18     print d
19     print "\n"
20  .end
\end{verbatim}
