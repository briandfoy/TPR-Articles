The back-end of the translator starts with resource assignment.
The only resource to consider here is memory. The task is
remarkably simple since PIR provides an infinite number of virtual
numeric registers named \verb|$N1|, \verb|$N2|, etc.

\begin{verbatim}
{{ my $num = 1; # closure
  sub new_N_register {
    return '$N'.$num++;
  }
}}

reg_assign: $x  => {
  if (ref($x) =~ /VAR|NUM/) {
    $x->{reg} = $x->{attr};
    return 1;
  }
  if (ref($x) =~ /ASSIGN/) {
    $x->{reg} = $x->child(0)->{attr};
    return 1;
  }
  $_[0]->{reg} = new_N_register();
}
\end{verbatim}
As it shows the code above (in file \verb|I2PIR.trg|), 
the resource allocation stage
is limited to assign virtual registers
to the inner nodes. 

A treeregexp term like \verb|$x| matches any node
and creates a lexical variable \verb|$x|
containing a reference to the node that matched.

In between Treeregexp rules the programmer can insert 
Perl code between curly brackets. 
The code will be inserted verbatim\footnote{Without 
the outer curly brackets.
If it weren't for the second pair of curly brackets
the lexical variable {\tt \$num} would be visible
up to the end of the file
} at that relative point by the \verb|treereg|
compiler. 

The \verb|Parse::Eyapp::YATW| object \verb|$reg_assign|
generated by the compiler is available inside
the main driver (revise section \ref{section:phases}):
\begin{verbatim}
our $reg_assign;
$reg_assign->s($t);
\end{verbatim}
Now we have an AST \I{decorated} with a new attribute \verb|reg|.
The following session with the debugger illustrates 
the way to expose the AST and its attributes:
\begin{verbatim}
$ perl -wd infix2pir.pl simple5.inf
main::(59): my $filename = shift;
DB<1> c 72    
-a*2        
EXPS(TIMES(NEG(VAR),NUM))    # The AST
\end{verbatim}
We have stopped the execution just before the 
call to \verb|$reg_assign->s($t)|. The AST
for input \verb|-a*2| was displayed.
\begin{verbatim}
main::(72): $reg_assign->s($t);
DB<2> n
main::(75): $t->bud(our @translation);
\end{verbatim}
After the register assignment phase
the nodes have been decorated with
the attribute \verb|$reg|. To display
a tree we use the \verb|str| method
of \verb|Parse::Eyapp::Node|. 
The \verb|str| method traverses the syntax tree dumping the type
of the node being visited in a string. If the node being visited
has a method \verb|info| it will
be executed and its result inserted between \verb|$DELIMITER|s
into the string. The package variable 
\verb|$INDENT|\footnote{Other \code{Parse::Eyapp::Node}
variables governing the behavior of \code{str} are:
\code{\@PREFIXES},
\code{\$STRSEP},
\code{\$FOOTNOTE\_HEADER},
\code{\$FOOTNOTE\_SEP},
\code{\$FOOTNOTE\_LEFT},
\code{\$FOOTNOTE\_RIGHT} 
and
\code{\$LINESEP}
}
controls the way the tree is displayed. Thus, the next three commands
display the AST and the values of the \verb|reg| attributes:
\begin{verbatim}
DB<2> *TIMES::info = *NEG::info = \
*VAR::info=*NUM::info=sub {$_[0]{reg}}
DB<3> $Parse::Eyapp::Node::INDENT=2
DB<4> x $t->str       # Decorated tree
0  '
EXPS(
  TIMES[$N2](
    NEG[$N1](
      VAR[a]
    ),
    NUM[2]
  ) # TIMES
) # EXPS'
\end{verbatim}
Observe that no registers
were allocated for variables and numbers.
