* Page 23, column 1, graf 7, line 6.  Change "then halt effectively
runs my_function with the rest of" to "then the test case is
my_function with the rest of".  "effectively runs" is incorrect.
What is done with the test case is up to the halt function, but
effectively running the test case is not a viable choice.


* Page 23, column 2, Table 1, top left cell.  "halt()" should be
in constant width font.  

* Page 23, column 2, Table 1, top middle cell.  "line 24" should be "line 7".
Clearly a typo.

* Page 24, column 1, graf 3, line 1.  "As noted in Table 1, If"
should be "As noted in Table 1, if".  Capitalization of "if".  Typo.

* Page 24, column 1, graf 3, line 3.  Change "c<test case>" to
"test_case" in constant width format.  Leftover POD formatting?

* Page 25, column 1, graf 5, line 2.  Change "when a brilliant idea
occurs to me" to "when an idea occurs to me".  Leave it to the
reader to decide whether the idea is brilliant or not.

* Page 25, column 1, graf 6, lines 3-4.  Change "Remember that
thought problems can be far-fetched!" to "(Remember that thought
problems can be far-fetched.)".  Restore parentheses, drop exclamation
point.  The remark comments on the narrative, so parentheses are
warranted.  I intended humorous understatement, and your rewrite
is better than my original on that score, but the exclamation point
defeats the purpose.

* Page 25, column 1, graf 7, lines 1-2.  Change "He some lines from
one of her poems:" to "He recited some lines from one of her poems:"
Fix missing verb, a typo from my original.

* Page 25, column 2, graf 2, line 1.  Change "In math, it's often
the case that I'm trying to prove something" to "It's often the
case that a mathematician is trying to prove something".  The idea
was to state how math works in general, not any special technique
of my own.

* Page 25, column 2, graf 4, line 2.  Change "it seems backwards,
but they use this sort of logic" back to "it seems backwards, but
we use this sort of logic".  Going to the third person ("we") changed
the meaning from "people in general" to "mathematicians", which
destroys the point of the sentence.  Especially now that the thought
problem is told in the first person, the pronoun needs to be "we"
to connect up the line of thought.

* Page 25, column 2, display 1, line 1.  Change "A: Assume that
scheme in the infomercial is a" to "Assume A: Assume that scheme
in the infomercial is a" with boldface "Assume A".

In all 3 repetitions of the reduction to absurdity pattern, I'd
like to change the initial "A." to "Assume A.", to reinforce the
point that I'm assuming A, not asserting it as a proven fact.  I
hope that's already clear, but I'd like to make it even more obvious.

* Page 25, column 2, display 2, line 1.  Change "A." to "Assume A."
As explained above.

* Page 26, column 1, graf 1, line 2.  Change "night scams, and
admiring my own brilliance, when the solution" to "night scams,
when the solution".  OOOOOH MY GOD.  I mean, like, really, please
change this!

* Page 26, column 1, graf 3, line 1.  Put "Acme::Halt::halt" into
constant width font.  For consistency.

* Page 26, column 1, graf 4, line 4.  Change "reductio ad absurdam"
to "reduction to absurdity" and drop the italics.  My mistake.  I'm
trying to keep things simple, so why am I speaking Latin?

* Page 26, column 1, display 1, line 1.  Change "A: Assume that
Acme::Halt::halt finds infinite" to "Assume A: Assume that
Acme::Halt::halt finds infinite" Boldface "Assume A", retain
constant width font for "Acme::Halt::halt".  As explained above.

* Page 26, column 1, graf 7, lines 1-2.  Change "A program might
also be able to figure out this loops forever:" to "A program could
also figure out that this loops forever:".  Eliminate weak wording.
My mistake.

* Page 26, column 1, last graf, lines 2-3.  Change "It might be
possible to detect a module which" to "It might be possible to write
a module that".  Changes "detect" to "write" and "which" to "that".
My mistakes.

* Page 26, column 2, graf 5, line 1.  Change "In fact, I tell the
HRPF board, that these restrictions forced" to "In fact, I tell the
HRPF board that these restrictions forced".  Eliminate misplaced
comma.  My mistake.

* Page 27, column 1, graf 3, line 5.  Change "the Turing machines
and the Halting Problem aren't adequate," to "Turing machines and
the Halting Problem aren't adequate,".  The "the" was my typo.

* Page 27.  Add Reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem

* Page 27, "About the Author".  Add at end of first paragraph:
"Jeffrey is the author the of Test::Weaken and Parse::Marpa CPAN
modules." Font "Test::Weaken" and "Parse::Marpa" should be as per
TPR style for module names.

* Page 27, "About the Author", last 3 lines.  One URL is in regular
font, the second is in italics.  Change so both follow TPR style.
