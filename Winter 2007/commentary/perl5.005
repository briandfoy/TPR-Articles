Goodbye Perl 5.005. I blame Leon Brocard, the maintenance pumpking for that version of Perl. How many of you even knew that? Leon recently released a new maintenance version of Perl 5.005 (wny?). That means, curiously, that the release date of the first Perl 5.8 ( ) pre-dates that for the most recent Perl 5.005 and Perl 5.6
Some of the CPAN Testers picked up on the new version of Perl and started checking the CPAN modules against it. All of a sudden, I was getting a lot of FAIL reports for modules that I thought were stable. The error reports has really weird errors that I don't normally see. David Cantrell, one of the CPAN Testers, was gracious remind me what was happening in Perl 5 and explain some of the problems in my modules when I complained about his broken testing set-up. I guess he gets that a lot. I hadn't been targetting 5.005 in my modules, and I hadn't received complaints about anything related to 5.005, so it didn't matter to me.
I could fix all of my modules to work with Perl 5.005, but I don't really want to support that. Instead, I've been putting into my Makefile.PL a "require 5.006". I'm not going to think about 5.005 compability. I'm not going to do anything to explicitly break it (such as, using our just for the heck of it), but I'm going to give people a little roadblock to get around. They can still try to install my modules by editing the Makefile.PL. If it works for them, great. If it doesn't, I'm not going to worry about it. If it's something that they can patch and I can incorporate into the module without a lot of work or big changes, I'll make the fix. I'm pushing that work onto the users though.
Michael Schwern had the same idea, although his decision to do the same thing has a lot more consequence since he's the maintainer of important modules such as ExtUtils::MakeMaker and Test::More. Future versions of those modules won't support 5.005.
I don't think it's going to matter that much. In the increasing unlikely situation where you are using Perl 5.005, the number of people keeping their modules current for that installations must reduce that to a handful of people. Some people are just gluttons for punishment.
