<pstyle:Feature Lead>The Perl Foundation (TPF) includes a grants program designed to provide a way to Perl programmers to see their projects developed with some monetary support. The grants program is run by the Grants Committee and headed by a committee chairperson, which is the position I currently hold.
<pstyle:Feature Para>At the present moment, we<0x2019>re updating the committee rules and grants process, but I<0x2019>ll tell you how it is now. So, some of the information here might be out of date or imprecise later. In any case, anyone can read our rules of operation for the latest rules.
<pstyle:Feature Section><cTypeface:Regular><cFont:Wingdings>n<cTypeface:><cFont:> Grants Proposal Evaluation	
<pstyle:Feature Section Lead>Any Perl programmer can make a proposal for development of a specific project, which can be as simple as bug fixing a specific module, developing a new module or extend an existing module. Also, it can include more complex tasks as the development of complete frameworks or the implementation of specific modules on Perl core.
<pstyle:Feature Para>There are a lot of successful TPF grants stories. The Perl Foundation website includes a reference to most of the completed grants. Nicholas Clark worked on Perl internals, Adam Kennedy<0x2019>s grant produced what is now Strawberry Perl, Chris Dolan wrote 20 new policies for Perl::Critic, and Jouke Visser developed pVoice.
<pstyle:Feature Section><cTypeface:Regular><cFont:Wingdings>n<cTypeface:><cFont:> Applying for a grant	
<pstyle:Feature Section Lead>Each three months, TPF publishes a call for grant proposals and anyone can submit one. This proposal should include, at least:

<pLeftIndent:><pFirstLineIndent:><bnListType:><pstyle:Feature Para><pSpaceBefore:4.500000>Although I am on this role for just some months, I can point some things you should take care when writing your proposal:
<pstyle:Feature Para>First, the project should benefit the Perl community as a whole. Do not propose a project to solve a specific problem for a coåmpany or small group of persons.
<pstyle:Feature Para>And, don<0x2019>t propose anything that is already done. It is better to propose an expansion to something already existing than to reinvent the wheel. Don<0x2019>t propose to write a new module when there are lots of modules for that same task. Try to contact the author and propose a fix or extension to make an existing module more interesting.
<pstyle:Feature Para>If you aren<0x2019>t sure of you can finish a big project, propose a smaller part of it, but explain the whole idea. Try to propose small generic modules that can be glued together to build the whole thing.
<pstyle:Feature Para>If you want to interact directly with Perl or Parrot development, first contact the project leaders, and check of your idea viability. This is probably a good idea for any project, but
<pstyle:Feature Section><cTypeface:Regular><cFont:Wingdings>n<cTypeface:><cFont:> Choosing the grants	
<pstyle:Feature Section Lead>At the end of the period for proposals submission, we publish proposals on the TPF website. At the moment we are using the TPF blog, but it might change next time. During a period of one or two weeks, depending on the feedback rate, we invite the Perl community to comment on any of the proposals. The idea is to discuss the relevance of the proposal and its guts. The proposer should visit its entry on the blog from time to time to answer to possible questions. This is a chance for the proposer to refine and improve their proposal.
<pstyle:Feature Para>The previous grant period was the first time that we<0x2019>ve made the proposals public as part of the selection process. So far, it worked out quite well. The public discussion of proposals let more people see how the process works, the basis of some of the votes. Instead of scaring people away, we had 18 grant proposals this time, which is much more than we typically have.
<pstyle:Feature Para>After this discussion period, the proposals will be evaluated by the grants committee. Normally, each member votes to reject or accept the proposal, or possibly abstain when there might be some interest conflict or the committee member doesn<0x2019>t think he is qualified to judge the proposal. Along with their votes, committee members can add a comment about the proposal.
<pstyle:Feature Para>As the chairperson, I collect the votes from all the members and divide the propoals into three groups: accepted, rejected, and everything else. An accepted proposal is not automatically funded.
<pstyle:Feature Para>From the accepted proposals, we analyze and discuss with TPF Board of Directors about how much money we can award that round. If we can<0x2019>t fund some of the accepted proposals, the committee ranks are ranks them GC; the top ranked proposals are funded. We delay until the next round the remaining accepted but not funded proposals.
<pstyle:Feature Para>For each funded proposal, we assign a grant manager to the proposal and the works should begin as soon as possible. The grant manager is responsible to help the communication between TPF and the grantee, and to write periodic progress reports based on the milestones and deliverables in the grant application.
<pstyle:Feature Para>For each one of the rejected proposals, we send a message is sent to the proposer with the comments from the committee so they can decide what to do with their proposal. They might try again for the next round of proposals. All unfunded or rejected proposals are delayed to the next round for a re-evaluation, as well. Each proposal is only held over for one round though.
