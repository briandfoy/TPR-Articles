<pstyle:Feature Lead>Each summer, Google sponsors a <0x201C>Summer of Code<0x201D> where it pays $5,000 per project to support students to work on open source projects over their summer break. Each student is mentored by a project representative.
<pstyle:Feature Para>The Google Summer of Code 2008 enters the <0x201C>And now we write code<0x201D> phase on May 26, with six students working under The Perl Foundation banner this year. I<0x2019>m very pleased with the quality of proposals and we<0x2019>re all looking forward to a great summer.
<pstyle:Feature Para>This year, I organized the mentors and applications for Perl projects through The Perl Foundation. I<0x2019>ll tell you about the accepted projects and give you some background on the organization and application processes.
<pstyle:Feature Section><cTypeface:Regular><cFont:Wingdings>n<cTypeface:><cFont:> Projects for 2008	
<pstyle:Feature Section Lead>The Perl project abstracts are listed online with all of the other SoC projects (http://code.google.com/soc/2008/perl/about.html). We<0x2019>ll put all of the projects into an aggregator for the students to post updates as they work, but we haven<0x2019>t done that yet. Here are short summaries of this summer<0x2019>s Perl projects---the students wrote excellent proposals and I think we might post the full texts soon because the abstracts don<0x2019>t do them justice:
<pstyle:Head3Style>Flesh out the Perl 6 Test Suite
<pstyle:Feature Para>Student: Adrian Kreher Mentors: Moritz Lenz, Jerry Gay, and Will Coleda Adrian Kreher will be transforming the Perl 6 Synopses into running code. Currently, the Perl 6 test suite for the language specification is in the Pugs repository and the test results are automatically merged into the Synopses (http://perlcabal.org/syn/). Adrian will identify key areas not already checked, especially edge cases, and write tests for them. He plans to make it through one synopsis per week.
<pstyle:Head3Style>wxCPANPLUS
<pstyle:Feature Para>Student: Samuel Tyler Mentors: Herbert Breunung, Jos Boumans, and Steffen Müller Samuel Tyler is going to create a wxPerl GUI for CPANPLUS, the tool that interacts with the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, mostly for inspecting and installing Perl modules. Currently CPANPLUS either operates from the command line through the <CharStyle:pod-C>cpanp<CharStyle:> tool or through other automatic, non-interactive tools. The project will have a YUM Extender-like interface (http://www.yum-extender.org---the popular GUI installer for yum package manager.)
<pstyle:Head3Style>Native Call Interface Signatures and Stubs Generation for Parrot
<pstyle:Feature Para>Student: Kevin Tew Mentors: Jerry Gay, chromatic, and Will Coleda Kevin Tew will be making it easier to use NCI (e.g. at runtime) for all parrot-hosted languages. This includes building a tool to parse C header files and then generate the dlfunc signatures and stubs to interface with the external C libraries. With this tool, Parrot-hosted languages would easily be able to use important libraries such as GSL, graphviz, and Expat.
<pstyle:Head3Style>Incremental Tricolor Garbage Collector
<pstyle:Feature Para>Student: Andrew Whitworth Mentors: chromatic, Jerry Gay, and Will Coleda\</em\> Andrew Whitworth will be tackling the task of creating a Parrot garbage collector which doesn<0x2019>t need to stop the world to take out the trash. The current Parrot garbage collector uses <0x201C>mark and sweep<0x201D>, so Parrot must inspect all objects when it decides to clean-up. While inspecting all objects, a Parrot program has to temporarily pause the useful work. A tri-color garbage collector works incrementally. <0x201C>White<0x201D> objects have not been checked, <0x201C>grey<0x201D> objects have been checked at the container level but their contents have not been checked, and <0x201C>black<0x201D> objects have been checked completely. In each pass, white objects turn to grey objects, grey to black objects, and black objects can be garbage collected. Breaking it into smaller tasks rather than a single pass should spread out the GC time and allow Parrot to keep more threads engaged in useful work.
<pstyle:Head3Style>Create Math::GSL
<pstyle:Feature Para>Student: Thierry Moisan Mentors: Jonathan Leto, Alberto Simões, and Steffen Müller Thierry Moisan will be writing, documenting, and testing a SWIG-based binding to the GNU Scientific Library (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/), which has over 1,000 functions to handle advanced and applied mathematics such as linear algebra, root-finding, and fast Fourier transforms. Thierry will create the Perl module <CharStyle:pod-C>Math::GSL<CharStyle:> to make these functions available directly from Perl.
<pstyle:Head3Style>Full Text Search Implementation for Bricolage CMS
<pstyle:Feature Para>Student: Krishnanunni P.N Mentors: Vivek Khurana and David Wheeler Krishnanunni P.N will add Postgresql-based full text searching to Bricolage (http://www.bricolage.cc/), the open source content management solution written in Perl. Postgres 8.3 and later can perform full-text searches (http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/textsearch-intro.html). Full text searches involves parsing the documents into tokens and converting the tokens into lexemes so different forms of the same word (<CharStyle:pod-I>i.e.<CharStyle:> dog and dogs) show up as the same word.
<pstyle:Feature Sub Section>This year<0x2019>s organization
<pstyle:Feature Para>A big thanks to these mentors and congratulations to these students. Although I<0x2019>m the project administrator, most of the work has been and will be done by other people.
<pstyle:Feature Para>Multiple people are listed as <0x201C>mentor and support staff<0x201D> for each project. In all cases, there is at least one person to backup the mentor, Herbert and Jos will be tag-team mentoring on wxCPANPLUS, some of the backups might end up playing assistant, and there is always somebody assigned to oversee things. In short, we<0x2019>ve planned everything with an N+1 failover architecture and usually a supervisor node. This should make sure that students always have someone to turn to (though I think we might need to clone more Jerry.)
<pstyle:Feature Para>The Perl community owes huge thanks and gratitude to all of the students who submitted proposals (which were of great quality, making it very difficult to decide) and all of the mentors and managers who volunteered, as well as all of you in the community who helped promote the program. Of the mentors who volunteered, some ended up without a project, but many put a good deal of effort into working with students and helping evaluate proposals. Thus, I will mention them here and remind them that they might not be off of the hook yet: Andy Armstrong, Ash Berlin, Shawn Boyette, Tim Bunce, Nik Clayton, Kieren Diment, Darren Duncan, Rodrigo Fernandes, Shlomi Fish, Urivan Flores, Richard Foley, Jeff Horwitz, Paul Johnson, Mark Keating, Adam Kennedy, Yuval Kogman, Jonathan Leffler, Stevan Little, Zbigniew Lukasiak, Joe McMahon, Shawn M Moore, Greg Sabino Mullane, Steve Peters, Chris Prather, Marcus Ramberg, Allison Randal, Jonathan Rockway, Daniel Ruoso, Michael Schwern, Gabor Szabo, Matt Trout, Reini Urban, Jesse Vincent, Mike Whitaker, Brock Wilcox, Simon Wistow, and Ruslan Zakirov.
<pstyle:Feature Para>I hope I didn<0x2019>t miss anyone, but if I did it is the fault of my filing system and not a reflection of my appreciation. Thanks also to anyone who contributed to the wiki pages---that effort played a role in Google accepting us into the program at all. A special thanks to Andy Armstrong for hosting the mailing lists, Richard Dice and the Perl Foundation for supporting my efforts, Steffen Müller, Alberto Simões, Jerry Gay, and Will Coleda for helping carry the load and keeping me sane, Vivek Khurana for writing the aggregator, and all of the folks at Enlightened Perl (http://www.enlightenedperl.org/) for getting organized (or should I say <0x201C>organised<0x201D>?) and making the effort to get a second, slightly different Perl umbrella through the door.
<pstyle:Feature Para>I do wish we had gotten more slots (we were certainly prepared for it) and it is unfortunate that so many mentors who volunteered were left with nothing to do. But, I think the only way to change that next year is to get more students interested in Perl and Parrot and get them to apply. The primary factor Google uses in assigning an organization<0x2019>s number of slots is a simple <0x201C>popularity<0x201D> metric---that is: how many students proposals the organization receives. Some organizations got over 100 proposals, but our 20 was about average. As an umbrella organization with over 40 mentors signed-up, that means we were somewhat disappointed.
<pstyle:Feature Para>So, yes: we had more mentors volunteer than the number of students who submitted proposals. I think this says a lot about the Perl community<0x2019>s enthusiasm, but maybe also says something about our demographic. We should try to do better with the publicity next year, but I am happy that we<0x2019>ve managed a 20% increase in slots from 2006 and an Inf% increase from last year where we had a whopping zero because we didn<0x2019>t try hard enough to get in. In any case, I<0x2019>m glad that so many mentors stepped up to pledge their support and the Perl community should thank them.
<pstyle:Feature Sub Section>Just Doing It
<pstyle:Feature Para>For those who don<0x2019>t know the story of 2007<0x2019>s Summer of Code, here it is: Everybody assumed that somebody else would take care of it; that<0x2019>s not the way it works. At the last minute, Bill Odom valiantly became the only person from the Perl community to do anything about trying to get Perl into SoC in 2007, which meant that he was submitting an application without a good <0x201C>project ideas<0x201D> page and unable to list any mentors having pledged their support, etc. Lesson: one person alone does not count as a mentor organization.
<pstyle:Feature Para>I was rather disappointed that Perl had no presence in 2007, and quite shocked when I saw that the mentor organization application deadline went by in the couple of weeks that I wasn<0x2019>t looking. Shocked because, while I may not be the most <0x201C>jacked in<0x201D> person on the internet, I<0x2019>m president of a Perl Mongers group and subscribed to no fewer than 10 perl mailing lists at any given time, yet I heard nothing about a call for volunteers. So I marked my calendar, and started asking around when March 2008 got here. Little did I know what I was getting myself into: I quickly found myself in charge of the process.
<pstyle:Feature Para>As with most leadership roles, the first task is to find good people, and then listen to them. I created a page on the perl5 wiki, then contacted several mailing lists and IRC channels asking for input and volunteers. The <0x201C>suggested projects<0x201D> page on the wiki quickly accumulated a large number of ideas from a variety of perl projects and many people volunteered to mentor or help in various ways.
<pstyle:Feature Para>The second leadership task is to make stuff up and sound like you know what you<0x2019>re doing. I spent about a week investigating our history from 2005-2006, as well as reading all of the program FAQ<0x2019>s and answering questions from mentors while writing our organization<0x2019>s application. Something that many people may not realize about Google<0x2019>s Summer of Code is that no organization gets a free pass: you always have to convince Google that your participation will help turn students into happy, smiling open source contributors. Google takes past participation into account, but it appears that the number of mentors and the quality and quantity of suggestions on your <0x201C>ideas page<0x201D> play a big part.
<pstyle:Feature Para>Once we had gotten accepted as a mentoring organization, I turned my efforts toward recruiting students. In retrospect, starting this portion even earlier than the mentor recruiting would have been good. Next year I think most organizations will start that in January or February---before the SoC program is even formally announced by Google. So, the Perl community should certainly start their student outreach efforts a number of weeks in advance for 2009. How many weeks? Well, since there are no formulas for this sort of thing and it is my job to make stuff up, I<0x2019>ll say that we should take the ratio of non-students to students in our community and multiply by ten. Applying this formula to the 2007 Perl Survey results says we should start our outreach efforts about five or ten years ago, so today is probably as good a time as any.
<pstyle:Feature Sub Section>Onward Into the Vast Unknown
<pstyle:Feature Para>Google<0x2019>s Summer of Code is a great way to introduce students into the Open Source community and a great opportunity for them to tackle a <0x201C>life size<0x201D> project complete with all of the uncertainties and complexities. All of this year<0x2019>s students prepared a detailed plan including identifying potential trouble spots. So, most of the projects have planned a few sacrificial features or spare time which can be spent on unforeseen difficulties. Here is where the mentors will earn their t-shirt: by guiding students past the pitfalls, helping them over the rough spots, and keeping the development focussed.
<pstyle:Feature Para>As the summer unfolds, we<0x2019>ll all be learning too and I<0x2019>m sure there will be plenty of excitement through to the conclusion in September. Before long, it will be time to start the process again---possibly with some of this year<0x2019>s students as next year<0x2019>s mentors.
