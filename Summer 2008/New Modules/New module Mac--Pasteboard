If your new module has full access to the Mac Paste-/Clipboard, would you consider talk to or working with the author of Clipboard.pm to include support for your new module into the Clipboard.pm one? That way, it wouldn't have to resort to shell commands any more.Just a suggestion. I think it would be a great win for users.Cheers,Steffen--Please allow a few days until the entry will appear in the publishedmodule list.Parts of the data listed above can be edited interactively on thePAUSE.
